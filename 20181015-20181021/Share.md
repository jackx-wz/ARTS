# The Zen of Python

```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
优美好于丑陋
Explicit is better than implicit.
明确好于含蓄
Simple is better than complex.
简洁好于复杂
Complex is better than complicated.
复杂好于杂乱
Flat is better than nested.
扁平好于嵌套
Sparse is better than dense.
宽松好于密集
Readability counts.
可读性好
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
特例不能凌驾于规则之上
Although practicality beats purity.
尽管实用性打败了纯粹性
Errors should never pass silently.
错误不能悄悄通过
Unless explicitly silenced.
除非明确需要忽略
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
有歧义，不猜测
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
应该有且仅有一种明确的解决方案
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
尽管这种方法咋看不明显，除非你是Dutch
Now is better than never.
现在好于永不
Although never is often better than *right* now.
永不好于匆促
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
实现方式很难描述，是不好的方案
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
实现方式易于描述，是好的方案
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
命名空间是绝妙的理念，需要多去使用
```
